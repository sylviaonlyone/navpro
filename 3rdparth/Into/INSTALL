You need to have Qt installed. If you don't already have a copy, get
one at http://qt.nokia.com/downloads.


Installation on Linux

Ensure that Qt environment is set up correctly. At the minimum, Qt
libraries must be found in system library path or in directory that is
in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. Into does this
automatically if you installed the Qt SDK to the default location or
set QTDIR correctly.

Type the following at the command prompt:

export QTDIR=/path/to/qtsdk/qt
. path/to/into/bin/intoenv

This adds into/lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH and into/bin to PATH.

If you downloaded the binary packages, you are done. Try the demos:

cd path/to/into/demos
./intodemo


Installation on Windows

Ensure that Qt environment is set up correctly. On windows, Qt dlls
must be found in PATH. The Into command prompt present in the start
menu after installation does this for you. Open the Into command
prompt and

cd path/to/into/demos
intodemo


Compiling Into

If you make changes to the source codes, or your version of Qt is not
compatible with the prebuilt binaries, you need to compile Into
yourself. Again, Qt environment must be set up correctly. Open a
terminal or Into command prompt and cd to "src" directory under the
installation directory. Then type the following commands:

On Linux/OS X:

qmake -r MODE=release
make
./install.sh release

On Windows, MinGW:

qmake -r MODE=release
mingw32-make
install release

On Windows, MSVC

qmake -r MODE=release
nmake
install release

This should build Into, all plug-ins, and demos and copy the binaries
over the prebuilt ones.

You can build your own software against Into by including
into/src/base.pri in your project file:

# Your own project file
INTODIR=into_install_dir/src
include($$INTODIR/base.pri)
SOURCES = ...
