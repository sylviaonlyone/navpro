Networking

Into comes with an easy-to-use, extensible networking library. The
framework can be used to implement many kinds of protocols, but the
current implementation is mainly focused on HTTP. Into uses HTTP to
implement network-transparent distributed applications.

The programs in this folder demonstrate different aspects of the
networking library.
