Into Demos

This folder contains a number of small programs that each demonstrate
a tiny part of the Into framework. The demonstration programs are not
useful applications as such, but work merely as tutorials on how to
exploit the functionality of the platform.

Into is designed for real-time processing of data, and most of the
demonstrations are implicitly multi-threaded. Please note however that
the purpose of the demonstrations is to visualize some functionality
and they are usually not optimized for best analysis speed.

The demo programs still lack documentation. The documentation links
are going to open a documentation page specific to each demonstration. 
For the time being, however, you'll be redirected to a search page
instead.
