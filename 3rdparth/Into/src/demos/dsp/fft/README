Fourier Transform

The Fourier transform is a way of representing an input signal as a
sum of sine waves. This program demonstrates the two-dimensional
Discrete Fourier Transform applied on an image. It shows the power
spectrum of an input image. Try it with regular patterns to see peaks
in the result.
