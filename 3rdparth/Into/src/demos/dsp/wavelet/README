Wavelet Transform

The discrete wavelet transform is a way of recursively decomposing an
input signal into orthogonal components. In one dimension, the
decomposition is performed with a pair of high-pass/low-pass filters
that are scaled and translated. In two dimensions, the decomposition
is done in both directions. This program demonstrates one level
of a two-dimensional wavelet decomposition.
