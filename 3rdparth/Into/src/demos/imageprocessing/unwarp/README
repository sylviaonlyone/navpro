Image Unwarp

Reads in a picture of cylinder and unwarps it. The result shows the
surface of the cylinder as if it was straightened. You need to
manually select the area to be unwarped.

Note 1: The cylinder (such as a pole) is assumed to be vertical in
images. You need to frame the cylinder with the mouse.

Note 2: This demonstration does not account for barrel distortion. If
the picture is taken with a wide-angle lens, the result will not be
rectangular.
