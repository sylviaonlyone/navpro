Corner Detector

Corner detectors are useful in many image processing applications. 
They can serve as the first step in keypoint recognition, which plays
a major role in template and stereo matching. This program
demonstrates the FAST corner detector, which, as the name implies,
works at video frame rates while providing good accuracy.
