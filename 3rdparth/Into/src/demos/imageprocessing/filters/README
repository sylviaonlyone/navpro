Image Filters

This program demonstrates image filtering with some prebuilt filters. 
It allows the user to change the type of the filter, its size, and the
method of handling image borders. One of the distinguishing features
of Into is that it automatically optimizes separable filters. In many
cases, it will be able to simplify two-dimensional filtering to two
one-dimensional passes.
