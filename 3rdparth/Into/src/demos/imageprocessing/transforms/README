Geometric Transforms

Geometric image transforms are a way of computationally altering an
image to look as if it was taken from a different position. Into
supports free affine transforms, of which this program demonstrates
rotation and scaling. Note that this is a demonstration program that
re-reads the input image from disk whenever you change the parameters
and applies scaling and rotation in sequence instead of with in one
pass. This significantly slows down the calculations.
