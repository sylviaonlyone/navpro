Boundary Finder

Boundaries of detected objects are useful in matching shapes of
objects. A prerequisite is that the objects are first successfully
separated from background. This is most often done with tresholding,
which is what this demonstration does.

The thresholding technique in use is an adaptive algorithm that
changes the threshold based on local image properties. The result is
inverted so that dark areas are regarded as pixels of the target
objects.
