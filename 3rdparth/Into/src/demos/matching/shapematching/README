Shape Based Matching

This program matches objects based on their shape, in this case the
outer and inner boundaries of the object. The program displays a
rotating image that contains objects to be detected in different
scales and orientations, overlapping each other. The images are
matched to a model database in a rotation and (to a certain degree)
scale invariant manner in real time. To extract the objects, this
demonstration uses a static gray-level threshold.
